# User Guide

Welcome to the user guide for our game **R-Type**.  
This guide will help you understand how to play and use the various options in the game. To learn how to install and launch our game, please click [here](../../README.md).

## Main Menu

Once the game is launched, you will be on the main menu. This menu consists of three buttons:

- **[PLAY]**: Starts the game.
- **[OPTIONS]**: Opens the options menu.
- **[EXIT]**: Exits the game.

### [OPTIONS] Menu

In the **[OPTIONS]** menu, you will find several settings to customize:

- At the top of the screen, you can adjust the **sound settings** for the game:
  - The first slider allows you to adjust the volume of the sound effects (e.g., mouse click sounds, player shots during the game).
  - The second slider allows you to adjust the volume of the overall game music (whether in the menu or during gameplay). Drag the slider to adjust the volumes.

- Below that, you will find five buttons to **change the control keys**. By default:
  - The **Up Arrow** moves the player up.
  - The **Down Arrow** moves the player down.
  - The **Right Arrow** moves the player right.
  - The **Left Arrow** moves the player left.
  - The **Enter** key toggles the autofire mode (the player shoots automatically).
  - The **Spacebar** allows you to shoot when autofire is disabled.

  To change a key, click the corresponding button for the action, then press the new key on your keyboard (for example, if you want the "Shoot" action to be the "L" key, click the "Shoot" button and then press the "L" key).

- Below, you can check or uncheck an option to **enable or disable a font change** for people with reading difficulties.

- There is also a third slider that allows you to **adjust the text size** in the game.

To exit this menu and return to the main menu, click the **"Back"** button in the top-right corner of the screen. Your settings will be saved automatically.

### Game Settings and IP Field

On the main menu, you will also find two text fields:

1. The first field allows you to enter your **player name**. If you leave it blank and click **[PLAY]**, your default username will be "Guest".
   
2. The second field allows you to enter the **IP address** of another computer to play multiplayer. Simply get the IP address of the PC running the server and enter it here. If this field is left empty, the default IP address will be your own PC's address (127.0.0.1). This feature is useful if you want to play multiplayer across different PCs.

Once you've filled out this information, you're ready to start the game by clicking **[PLAY]**!

## In-Game

Once in the game, you can move by using the arrow keys on your keyboard or the keys you configured in the game options.  
To shoot once, press the **Spacebar** (or the key you configured in the options).  
To activate autofire, press **Enter** (or the configured key), and press it again to deactivate it.

### Enemies and the Boss

During the game, you will encounter up to 4 types of enemies, each with different characteristics (some have more health or deal more damage than others, for example).  
At the end of the level, you will face a **boss**, recognizable by its massive size. To win, you must defeat the boss, but be careful not to get eliminated before that!

## Map Creation

You also have the option to **create your own maps**. Click [here](../../map_editor/README.md) and follow the guide to generate a new map.
