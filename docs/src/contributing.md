# Commit Standard for R-Type

This document outlines the commit standard applied on R-Type project. This convention ensures clear and structured messages for better readability and code management.

## Commit Message Structure

Each commit message must follow this format:
```
<TYPE>: <DESCRIPTION>
```
- **TYPE**: The type of change, written in **uppercase**.
- **DESCRIPTION**: A concise and precise description of the modification.

### Main Types

| Type         | Description                                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ADD**      | Adding a new feature                                                   |
| **FIX**      | Fixing a bug                                                           |
| **DOCS**     | Modifying or adding documentation                                      |
| **STYLE**    | Changes related to formatting (e.g., spaces) without functional impact |
| **REFACTOR** | Refactoring code without adding features or fixing bugs                |
| **TEST**     | Adding or updating tests                                               |
| **RM**       | Delete one thing                                                       |

### Example Messages

- **Adding a feature**:
  ```
  ADD: collision system for missiles
  ```

- **Fixing a bug**:
  ```
  FIX: Fixed crash when moving player
  ```

- **Updating documentation**:
  ```
  DOCS: Updated installation instructions
  ```

- **Improving style**:
  ```
  STYLE: Applying clang-format to source files
  ```

## Additional Rules

- **Language**: All commit messages must be written in English.
- **Length**: Descriptions should fit in a single line (around 72 characters).
- **Conciseness**: Avoid unnecessary details. Detailed explanations must be added in an extended description.

### Extended Format
For complex commits, you must add an extended description after a blank line:
```
<TYPE>: <DESCRIPTION>

<EXTENDED DESCRIPTION>
```

Example:
```
FIX: Fixed poorly rendered borders on enemies

Borders were misaligned due to a problem in the method
render() of the Enemy object. The function has been fixed to handle sizes.
```

## Merging the code

To participate in the project, you must create GitHub branches. It is not possible to push directly to the main or dev branches.
Your new branch must be based on the dev branch.
Once you want to share your work, you need to create a pull request from your branch to the dev branch. This must be accepted by one of the project creators. Once the pull request is accepted, you can then merge your work.
During regular project updates, the dev branch is merged into the main branch.
