# Client

The Client class manages the overall operation of the client.

It orchestrates the various components required for the gameâ€™s operation, from initializing the server to managing the entities to be displayed.

| manageClient                        | The manageClient function is the main loop of the client.

It runs as long as the window remains open. |
