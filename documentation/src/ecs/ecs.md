# Entity Component System (ECS)

Entity Component System (ECS) is a design architecture commonly used in game development and simulations. It emphasizes separation of concerns by dividing the functionality into three core components:

- **Entities**: These are unique identifiers that represent individual objects in the system.
- **Components**: These are data containers that hold specific attributes or properties of an entity.
- **Systems**: These are responsible for the behavior and logic, operating on entities that have the required components.

By decoupling data (components) from logic (systems) and organizing them around entities, ECS enables flexibility, performance, and easier management of complex systems.
