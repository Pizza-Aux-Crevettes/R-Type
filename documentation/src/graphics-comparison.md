## Why We Chose SFML

We chose to use **SFML** for the following reasons:
1. **Adequate performance**: SFML is optimized for 2D games like R-Type and provides performance suitable for the projectâ€™s needs.
2. **Ease of use**: Its simplicity allows faster development and debugging, which is crucial for meeting project deadlines.
3. **Past experience**: We have previously worked with SFML during our studies, reducing the learning curve.
4. **Quality documentation**: SFML offers clear documentation along with practical tutorials, speeding up development.
